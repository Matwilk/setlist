 - instrument in player field is storing as string representation of index of list as found when loading list of instruments.  However, if list changes (someone removed/added) then link no longer accurate?
 - global variable for things like instrument and name list 
 - add set list node itself
 - allow ordering of songs within the setlist
 - format forms better
 - ideally use proper custom field behaviour rather than suppressing the add more behaviour
 - does uninstall work cleanly ?
